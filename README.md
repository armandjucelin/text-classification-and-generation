# text-classification-and-generation
've attached a simple text data ("text_data.csv") that I already labeled (0 = abnormal text and 1 = normal text)  in a csv file and I need the following:

1-  Using Python, fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for binary classification and in addition, 

2-  Use metrics to evaluate the performance of the model (precision, recall, accuracy, F-1 score, etc). 
Any visuals to visualize both classes would be appreciated too
